# Timing Algorithms
Using complex algorithms to time and compare them using 3 data files containing 10000 names.
Provides with the option to save the sorted names into a .txt files after they have run.

# What I learned
* Integrated 3 complex algorithms - Mergesort, Heapsort & Quicksort
* File I/O to read and write data files with 10000 names
* Sort files containing Ascending, Descending and Random names within the files using the 3 mentioned algorithms and then time them
* After sorting is done, give names to output files with the results of the sorting and get a clean presentation of the time it took for each algorithm

# Usage
Driver contains the main method that needs to be run.
